# Cashflow Minimisation

### Introduction

- This project is an implementation of algorithm used in apps like Splitwise.
- The basic aim is to simplify the transactions between people.

### Technologies Used

_JavaScript
_ [Vis.js](https://visjs.org/) \* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### How does it works:

- The project randomly generates data in form of a graph.
- The nodes represent people and the edges represents the transaction between them.
- Every time on clicking **Get New Problem** it will create a new graph.
- On clicking **Solve** it will simplify the complex graph into a simpler version. \* It then becomes easier to settle the transactions between different people which earlier was a difficult task.
