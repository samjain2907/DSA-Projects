This is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorthim to calculate the shortest distance between two citites in a randomly generated graph.
The graphs as well as the algortihm is implemented using JavaScript.
The visual efect iscreated using Vis.js.
This project will automatically generate different graphs every time and will calculate the shortest distance between the starting and the ending nodes.
